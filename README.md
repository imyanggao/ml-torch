# ml-torch
  A deep learning playground based on torch framework. This repo is inspired by facebook's resnet repo, but with more generic design for any supervised learning. The repo currently supports the following tasks:
  * image classification
  * semantic segmentation
  * sequence-to-sequence learning
  * diffeomorphic registration

  with the following features:
  * multi-threading data loader
  * multi-gpu training
  * learning rate scheme and regime
  * checkpoint retrain and resume
